# Ruby Firebase Auth

I have a Rails App where I need to authenticate firebase users on the server-side, not just in JavaScript.

I found these instructions from google:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens

Unfortunately, it appears Google does not have support for Ruby. So, I made my own auth file!

This gem is an extraction of that file and is still in development.
